# Overview of HiFi's Documentation Tools

For High Fidelity's main documentation system, we use **Sphinx** to generate it, and **Read the Docs** to publish/host it. GitHub is a helpful middleman and stores all of the docs.

**Sphinx** is an open-source, robust solution for software documentation that includes features that writers expect, like:

* Single Source Publishing (HTML, PDF, ePub, and more)
* Content reuse through includes
* Multiple mature HTML themes that provide great user experience on mobile and desktop
* Referencing across pages, documents, and projects
* Index and Glossary support
* Localization support

**Read the Docs** is a hosting platform for Sphinx-generated documentation. It takes the power of Sphinx and adds version control, full-text search, and other useful features. It pulls down code and doc files from Git then builds and hosts the documentation. 

Our main documentation is hosted at https://docs.highfidelity.com.
