"As an international project, Vircadia relies on translators to be able to"

"<https://weblate.vircadia.dev>`_ by either submitting translations or "
"becoming a maintainer for your language and checking translations before "
"they make it into the documentation. More information on translating the "

"the documentation. Bounties are created and assigned based on trust, so "
"if you are unsure about something regarding one then speak to a core "
"developer or bring it up at a community or developer meeting. Most of the"
" developers are highly trained and experienced, normally earning upwards "
"of US$40 an hour in the free market. Keep that in mind if you want to see"
