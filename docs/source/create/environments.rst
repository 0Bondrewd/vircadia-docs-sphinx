Environments
####################

A High Fidelity domain can have an environment to express a theme. Environments include all the domain content, such as entities, skyboxes, assets, and more. You could have a domain with a deserted island environment or a cyberpunk apartment environment. 

Environments are available for `purchase on our Marketplace <../../explore/bank-and-shop>`_. If you don't want to use any of the available environments, you can create your own.

An environment consists different types of 3D models and a skybox following the theme of your choice. You can create an environment using:

| Marketplace Items      | You can `purchase various models <../../explore/bank-and-shop>`_ like buildings and skyboxes    |
|                        | from the Marketplace. For example, you can change the skybox in your domain by purchasing a     |
|                        | different one from the Marketplace.                                                             |
+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3D Models Available    | You can `purchase or get 3D models from online 3D content websites <../3d-models/get-model>`_.  |
|                        | Then, you can `import these models using the Asset                                              |
|                        | Server <../3d-models/import-model#import-3d-models-using-the-asset-server>`_.                   |
+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Your 3D Models         | You can use 3D modeling software like Blender or Maya to create your own 3D models and          |
|                        | `import them into your High Fidelity                                                            |

+------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A Content Archive File | High Fidelity domain settings have downloadable content archives. These archives are zip        |
|                        | files containing all domain content information. You can `use a backup file of your own or one  |
|                        | sent to you by a user <../../host/backup-restore-domain#restore-your-domain>`_.                 |
