At the end of each entry, there are PR numbers that refer to their PRs in the Project Athena [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kasenvr/project-athena/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3Av0860-k2).

#### General

* Settings > Entity Script / QML Whitelist added. Loading third-party QML now works correctly, provided that the file is added to the whitelist. (#1, #6, #7, #16, #65, #112)
* The ability for the Metaverse API (Grid Server) URL to be changed by script via settings has been added. No UI toggle has been added yet. (#33)
* Added full desktop chat UI with local, domain, and inter-domain capabilities. Not in a VR usable state yet. (#12, #13, #69, #88, #107, #111, #135, #170)
* Serverless JSON domains can now be loaded over HTTP. This means you can create a domain, export it to JSON, then upload it to a webserver to be visited in the Interface. (#160)
* Beta default scripts feature added where if you check Developer > Scripting > Enable Beta Default Scripts then you get the latest versions for some scripts via their respective online deployments. (#135, #192)
* Users can now set thumbnails that show in the Avatar app. (#145)
* Add SL-like camera inspect function (hold Alt key) as default functionality. (#64, #188)
* Add clicking/triggering on an avatar shows a temporary nametag. (#179)
* Add an "Explore" app as a temporary go-to, along with associated "Explore" menu in Interface. These will be replaced by a modern implementation upon or after the Metaverse API (Grid Server) completion. (#190)
* Add a "More" app that lists and installs community-made scripts and apps directly from a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kasenvr/community-apps).
* This takes longer than you might expect: Tons of revisions to brand/debrand, update links, docs, rehost, etc. in the Interface by various contributors. Thank you! (#9, #11, #19, #23, #34, #37, #38, #40, #44, #47, #50, #58, #70, #71, #75, #85, #89, #91, #99, #100, #105, #116, #177)
