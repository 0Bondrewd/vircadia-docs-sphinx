#### Pricing
<a name="q1"></a>
**How should I price my Marketplace Item?**

You are free to price your item however you'd like. If you're unsure how to start, you can refer our [pricing guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZMV-1OD3pPBOgBmv7EhQ9q5JW9in3lX30QKUh5HlXQ4/edit?ts=5b6c675e&pli=1#slide=id.p).


#### Asset Size
<a name="q2"></a>
**Does my avatar have too many polys?**

Your avatar should have fewer than 40k polygons. Any more would stress the system too much.


<a name="q3"></a>
**How big can my submission be?**

Your submission should be under 40 MB. Large files will affect user experience as they will take longer to download. Items with only scripts should be smaller than a 3D model. 



#### Uploading
<a name="q4"></a>
**How do I upload to the Marketplace?**

Log in to the [Marketplace home page](https://highfidelity.com/marketplace) and select ‘New Submission’ from the top right drop-down menu.


<a name="q5"></a>
**Can I host content on the Marketplace for personal use?**

You can submit content without putting it up for sale. However, you will still need to go through the certification process and be held to Marketplace standards. Content not submitted for review, will expire after 30 days and will no longer be accessible.
Keep backups of your files! We cannot assure the return of your files if they are corrupted or lost.



#### Acceptance
<a name="q6"></a>
**What happens after I submit my item to the Marketplace?**

Your submission will be evaluated by our team. Once our team has completed evaluation, you will receive an email telling you that your item was accepted or declined with reasons and resubmission guidelines.



#### Timing
<a name="q7"></a>
**How long does it take to find out about the status of my submission?**

The Marketplace team will respond by email within 7 business days. 



#### Content Rules
<a name="q8"></a>
**What are the rules for submitting content to the Marketplace?**

Please refer to our [Marketplace Submission Rules](submission-rules).



#### DMCA
<a name="q9"></a>
**How do I report a DMCA violation?**

Email us at [support.highfidelity.io](mailto:support@highfidelity.io) to report content violation, and we will take appropriate action.
