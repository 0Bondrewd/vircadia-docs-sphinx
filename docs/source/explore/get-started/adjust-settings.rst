Adjust Your Settings
#########################

You can adjust various settings in High Fidelity so that it runs to your preferences. Many of these settings are changed using the HUD (in Desktop mode) or Tablet (in VR mode).

------------------------
The Tablet and HUD
------------------------

In VR, all of your settings are found in your **Tablet**. The Tablet also gives you easy access to any :doc:`apps that you install <../personalize/install-apps>`. Pull up the tablet by clicking the menu button on your controller.

In Desktop Mode, you have the option to use either the Tablet or a smaller version called the "Heads-up Display" or HUD. It contains the exact same options as the Tablet (settings, apps, etc), but it takes up less space on your screen. To enable the HUD, first enable the **Developer** menu by going to **Settings > Developer Menu**. Then, go to **Developer > UI > Desktop Tablet Becomes Toolbar**.

------------------------------
Enter or Exit VR Mode
------------------------------

You can enjoy High Fidelity with or with VR equipment such as head mounted displays (HMD), hand controllers and audio headsets. Our Desktop mode contains many of High Fidelity's features such as audio, basic movements and gestures, and the ability to travel to different domains. 

Keep in mind, however, that the most immersive and powerful experience is when you use VR equipment. Only then will you be able to interact with people in 3D, track body movements, and easily engage with the objects around you. Once you have set up your VR equipment, you can easily switch between VR mode and Desktop mode. To switch to VR mode, use one of the following methods: 

1. From the HUD, click **Enter VR**.
2. Click the **Display** menu, then select your VR device. 

To exit from VR mode, remove your headset, click **Exit VR** on the HUD or press ``ESC`` on your keyboard.

------------------------------
Change Your Audio Settings
------------------------------

High Fidelity spatializes audio in real-time based on the location of the listener and the sound sources. A good headset will enhance your experience. You can adjust your audio settings by going to **Audio** on your tablet or HUD.

Input Devices 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An audio input device is any software or hardware device that accepts an output signal from another device. Examples of audio input devices include:

* A USB microphone
* A microphone headset that is plugged into your computer via the "Mic In" port
* Your sound card’s “Stereo Mix” device

	* Think of these devices as if they were microphones being held up to your speakers while they output sound
	
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Output Devices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An audio output device produces a signal that drives another device’s input. Examples of audio output devices include:

* Desktop computer speakers
* Headphones
* Huge speakers in a movie theater


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Acoustic Echo Cancellation 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Acoustic echo is the process by which sounds from your speakers get picked up and transmitted by your microphone, resulting in an echoing effect. This is common when you use High Fidelity with a laptop's built-in microphone and speakers (i.e. an "open mic"), rather than a detached headset.

"Acoustic echo cancellation" is a technology which improves voice quality by preventing the echo that results in open mic setups. By default, Acoustic Echo Cancellation is turned on, and you can turn it off in Settings > Audio.

For best performance with open mic setups, ensure that you:

* Disable any processing and effects on the input and output devices. This includes:

    * On Mac: Turn off 'Ambient noise reduction' (System Preferences > Sound > Input > Use ambient noise reduction)
    * On Windows: Turn off all 'Enhancements' (Control Panel > Sound > Recording tab > click on your device > Properties button > Enhancements tab)

* On Mac devices, set the balance of the output device to either the left or the right (System Preferences > Sound > Output > Balance)
* Lower the microphone's physical gain setting to approximately 3/4 of the maximum
* Lower the speaker's physical volume level to approximately 3/4 of the maximum
* If you are not using your laptop's audio devices, move and point the microphone away from the speakers

The acoustic echo cancellation technology picks up the sounds around you and attempts to identify the echoing sounds as you use it. This means that it will improve and become more accurate over time. So don't despair if you hear a little bit of echoing...it will lessen as the technology learns your voice and the voices of the people around you! 

To speed up this "learning" process, you can:

* Avoid turning your avatar while talking
* Leave your microphone muted while another person talks for 10 seconds at a time


-----------------------------
Set Your Perspective
-----------------------------

You can choose how you view things around you by changing your perspective. To change your perspective: 

* In Desktop mode, go to **View** in the menu on the top left corner. 
* In VR mode, open your Tablet and go to **Menu > View**.
